## automated tools for black box testing:

1. Selenium: A widely-used open-source testing framework that allows testers to automate the testing of web browsers, making it a valuable tool for performing black box testing on web-based systems.
2. LoadRunner: A performance testing tool that can be used for black box testing of non-functional requirements such as load, stress, and endurance.
3. JMeter: An open-source tool that can be used for black box testing of non-functional requirements such as load, stress, and endurance.

the most hard task.

Firstly, Completely understand the question, README.

??? WHY

hack the answer, but not debugging, what’s the bug of this program?

sometimes we can not get through the assignment ,if we follow the instruction of README and courses documents totally

Command line: 

`print,` does not work.

`next , disp myNumber` but disp does work.

how can we guess the answer?

round 1 = 464384013
