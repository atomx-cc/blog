As the old saying goes, “Know your enemy and know yourself, and you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.” Even as a child, I was curious about what those “foreign devils” were really up to—why were they constantly scheming to steal something from us? I believed that to understand them, one needed to decipher their “still-undeveloped and clumsy language symbols.”\nThus, many of us began learning English or Japanese with a sense of hostility, even approaching all foreign languages with enmity.\nI was born in the mountains of central China—a remote, backward rural area where people were poor and uneducated. Among my primary and secondary school friends, a popular saying was, “I’m Chinese; why bother learning a foreign language?” This became an excuse to simply submit a blank response to teachers and parents without reproach. Those people now either toil in the fields or move bricks at construction sites. This is not meant as mockery but as an observation of the excuse-makers whose lives usually end up bleak. Of course, white-collar workers also “move bricks,” but working in a modern office building with warm winters and cool summers feels much easier.\nWe were also taught the principle of “Chinese learning with Western application.” History textbooks weren’t entirely wrong. Even though they criticized the incomplete “self-strengthening” approach of the late Qing reformists who failed to grasp the essence of Western science, many people even today remain resistant toward learning foreign languages and accepting foreign cultures.\nCultural Gene Culture is an abstract concept. To explain my perspective on the essence of language, here’s an analogy:\nAll foreign languages, cultures, and technologies are like beverages stored in bottles or jars. The authentic flavor is preserved only when consumed straight from the original container. With different regions and ethnic groups producing a wide variety of flavors, whether local or foreign, there will always be those who like or dislike a particular taste. There are two types of people:\nA: Those who drink mainly for social interaction, keen to try every new, exotic flavor. For them, alcohol is simply a medium for social exchange; the goal is achieved in one gathering, and the empty bottles are discarded. This is the lifestyle of the wealthy and the aristocrats.\nB: Those who do not have a drinking habit or cannot afford quality alcohol, who end up collecting empty bottles and containers, sometimes stuffing them with various items. Their houses fill up with mismatched, broken bottles—this is the lifestyle of the poor.\nMany people treat foreign languages and technologies merely as containers, filling them with their own “homemade” additions. Whether in appearance or taste, this hodgepodge often lacks authenticity.\nIf the words, phrases, and grammar of a language are like the grains or fruits used to brew a drink, then exploring the deep core of a language—its specific context of philosophy, belief, religion, and theology—is like uncovering the microorganisms and techniques used in brewing. Therefore, a deeper level of language learning should focus on embracing its excellent way of thinking and spirit.\nWhat you eat and drink determines your social status. In the dark, corrupt society of the past, corrupt officials and cunning businessmen would drink expensive brandy with shark fin, bear paw, or bird’s nest soup; whereas in a civilized society, the elite favor floral teas paired with plant-based proteins as a trend towards low-carbon, eco-friendly lifestyles.\nIf you cannot appreciate a particular drink or integrate into its social setting, remember that even after millions of years of evolution, humans—like other organisms—recognize one another by scent. There is a unique, almost intangible form of soft cultural power in that.\nEven a tycoon with several private wine cellars might not appreciate the authentic taste of a renowned European vineyard if he does not belong to that social circle. In contrast, while replicating a bottle or its external packaging is relatively easy, obtaining the authentic brewing materials and the specific microbial fermentation process—developed over decades or even generations in a unique cultural setting—is much harder to imitate. That authenticity becomes part of one’s very marrow.\nThis is the insight someone who had attained a deep understanding of Western culture shared with me. As it goes beyond the scope of this article, I will pause here.\nThe deeply ingrained mindset of “Chinese learning with Western application” subtly instills a sense of hostility toward foreign cultures—a phenomenon widespread across different nations and regions—in education. This manifests as being “closed off, narrowly confined, and ignorant of the broader world,” which naturally hinders effective learning because it lacks a genuine openness toward other cultures.\nWhen we left high school, we had studied English for six years and then received an additional two years of English instruction in college—totaling eight years of study. Yet when we started working, like most of my peers, our spoken English was almost non-existent—not even at a basic level. This was partly due to the limited educational conditions in our remote, mountainous K12 schools.\nAt that time, the Internet wasn’t developed, and we had little chance to see the outside world. Yet I vaguely sensed that the progress among Westerners was rapid—they had evolved from primitive beginnings into civilized people in no time. Their advancements in science, art, and general social welfare far exceeded the treatment of people in the so-called Third World.\nMore importantly, beyond learning a practical tool like a foreign language, it is crucial to understand the real outside world. One must not assume that ready access to Internet information automatically leads to objective understanding.\nHow powerful can a long-established, rigid mindset be? Many people have already emigrated overseas, yet even after leaving, they continue to cling to their narrow native mentality. They leave their homeland only to find that, abroad, they still “carry their well” on their shoulders: unable to speak the local language, uninterested in local news and events, and confined to a narrow social circle of their own nationality. Instead, they pass their time playing mahjong, square dancing in parks, or enjoying street barbecue.\nYes, they fill foreign containers with their own “home-brew,” resulting in an inauthentic flavor. They may claim admiration for another civilization, but in practice, their lifestyle and mindset never truly integrate into the local society.\nSuccess Mindset Overcoming one’s inner obstacles is the key to overcoming everything.\nRecently, I was watching a course on learning methods taught by reputed “master teachers” from multiple disciplines including industrial and systems engineering, computer science, neurobiology, brain science, and psychology (which is why extracurricular tutoring centers especially like to recommend renowned teachers to parents). It’s best to watch the entire course. In one of the lessons, the instructor interviewed Benny—a person born with a language learning disability who, through sheer effort, became a polyglot and public speaker. His experience is very enlightening for learning any subject.\nHere’s an interview with “Benny the Irish Polyglot” about how to learn: Optional Interview with “Benny the Irish Polyglot” about Learning Languages\nBenny’s Website\nI deeply agree with the two points Benny shared:\nFall in love with the language itself rather than just learning a few phrases to show off—without the right attitude, success is hard to achieve. Start speaking immediately. It’s far more important to overcome the fear of speaking than to avoid communication. Once you overcome your mental barrier, nothing can stop you. Overcoming Psychological Barriers Failures and mistakes can take many forms, but the principles of success are always similar.\nThis reminds me of another successful language learner from China—Li Yang. They share many similarities: similar memorization methods, the use of body movements and public speaking techniques in teaching, and both overcame psychological barriers and fears to eventually learn multiple foreign languages and become effective speakers.\nI never attended Crazy English training, nor do I enjoy the boisterous style of speaking loudly in public. However, I once listened to one of Mr. Li’s online speeches—it was very compelling. For anyone interested in learning, I recommend listening; self-motivation is essential, as no one else can build your confidence for you.\nWe see many people around us who have achieved high levels in foreign languages. Countless successful individuals have shared their learning methods and insights. This is a universal phenomenon—success is less about innate talent and more about effective methods coupled with hard work. I wholeheartedly agree with them. Although my unconventional, self-taught approach left some gaps in my foundational skills, I know that strengthening those fundamentals is essential for further improvement.\nEven though my unorthodox method might seem random, it does follow its own set of rules. Unless you’re extraordinarily gifted, don’t upset the natural rhythm. I have summarized some specific learning methods in another article called English Basic Skills.\nThe Essence of Language Learning a language doesn’t necessarily require heavy academic thinking; it’s about cultivating interest, feeling, and experience.\nLanguage fundamentally involves listening and speaking—that is, pronunciation—rather than reading, writing, or grammar. Long before humans invented writing systems and books, language already existed. The history of oral communication far predates that of written language, so the initial phase of language learning should focus on pronunciation.\nPronunciation is a physical exercise involving the muscles of the mouth, chest, and abdomen. While some claim that vibrato or vocal cord vibration isn’t the main secret behind good pronunciation (as many singers and public speakers assert), following natural phonetic rules facilitates memory and spontaneous, fluent speech—as if bypassing conscious thought. This phenomenon is similar to the impromptu skills displayed by accomplished speakers and hosts.\nDue to geographic distribution and even the earth’s rotational forces, for instance, Eastern variants of Japanese have only one nasal sound with more front articulation, producing crisp, staccato sounds reminiscent of a machine gun; whereas Europeans tend to produce deeper, chest-resonated sounds emerging from the throat. Some say this contributes to the production of great tenors and basses—and perhaps even why Vienna, Austria, is renowned as a world music capital. (Why haven’t we seen similarly renowned musicians from Asia? That’s a discussion for another time.)\nPerhaps regional phonetic characteristics are influenced by planetary forces—a notion I sometimes ponder while gazing at a globe.\nNot only for learning English—across every language I’ve encountered, the basic ability required does not rely on logical reasoning. Unlike subjects such as mathematics, physics, or chemistry, learning languages is more akin to practicing music, dance, art, sewing, cooking, or masonry—skills that do not necessarily require formal education but are honed through experience.\nThere’s nothing mysterious about language. At the basic level, simply following its phonetic rules and practicing repeatedly is enough. Some might say my English is good, but compared to a native speaker—even a person who is illiterate or has cognitive challenges—my listening and speaking skills pale in comparison. In other words, fundamental language ability is not strictly tied to one’s level of formal education or IQ.\nAs social beings, humans developed language over hundreds of thousands or even millions of years—a natural ability that doesn’t require formal teaching. A hundred years ago, during mass migrations, people managed to communicate and survive in environments where the language was entirely different.\nLanguage is an innate talent, just like other natural abilities found in animals. As long as one is exposed to a language-rich environment, they will absorb the language naturally. In most cases, acquiring basic communication skills does not require extra teaching or reinforcement.\nLanguage Environment First, we must be grateful to have been born in a wonderful era. Although physical migration is not completely free, the Internet and modern communication tools allow most people to create their own virtual language environment.\nImmersive Learning Environment No matter where you are, the most direct way to build a language environment is to change the channels through which you receive and send information. For example, set your computer and mobile device operating systems to a foreign language, use Google (or Microsoft’s international Bing if Google isn’t available) instead of a native search engine.\nSwitch all your music, radio, and TV channels to foreign language stations. When I first needed to improve my spoken language skills for work, I used to sleep with a radio playing in a foreign language. In the morning, even if I didn’t understand everything, the monotonous sentences acted like a lullaby. Gradually, as I began to understand more, my overall feel for the language—a sort of “language sense”—started to develop.\nLanguage sense is an experiential form of understanding that’s hard to describe. Every native language is subconsciously acquired during the early, unformed stages of brain development—even those who never attended school form this instinct.\nCross-Cultural Exchange A further step in immersive learning is engaging in cross-cultural exchanges—the best way to truly learn a language. If you lack the means to travel, you can invite international tutors or cultural exchange partners to come and “service” you.\nThanks to the Internet, there are now convenient platforms in China such as Couchsurfing, Hospitality Club, Helpx, and WWOOF. With these work-for-accommodation platforms, you can host international backpackers who in exchange for a few hours of language practice each day, help you improve. After months of intensive practice, you’ll find it almost impossible not to start speaking. Of course, you need to know how to use these platforms to advertise your need.\nIf you have the means, you might also consider traveling as a backpacker. Not only does this lower travel costs, but it also allows you to deeply experience the local culture—intensive interaction with foreign tutors becomes a daily exercise. It’s best to do this before the age of 30, as many developed countries offer Working Holiday Visas (WHV) specifically for young people to work and travel.\nI believe that even someone who has only completed high school has the basic foreign language and computer skills needed to build an immersive learning environment. Unfortunately, many friends who asked me for advice on learning English ended up being university graduates; those with lower educational backgrounds rarely even consider learning a foreign language. This reflects not only a problem with the English curriculum but a broader misalignment between our outdated education system and real-life needs.\nI plan to write another article in the future to introduce the concept of a gap year and Working Holiday Visas, as well as the impact that differing cultural and educational systems between China and other countries have on young people. Personally, I carved out my own unconventional path because I stepped outside the traditional system.\nLearning Steps Most people learn English the same way I did—attending training classes and school courses—but I couldn’t absorb the material that way. I ended up wasting both money and time with minimal progress, so I eventually decided to follow my own instincts. Surprisingly, this unorthodox approach allowed me to develop a good language sense; my listening and speaking skills gradually became fluent. Although vocabulary and grammar remained my weak points—especially since those are the specialties of classmates from formal language programs—I rarely needed the advanced vocabulary or grammatical structures taught in higher-level courses.\nWithout a solid foundation, any skyscraper built in the air will eventually collapse. Even though I’ve passed the beginner stage, I still feel my foundation is not yet strong enough. Any further improvement will require reinforcing the basics.\nWhat may seem like a random, unconventional approach actually follows certain rules. Unless you’re extraordinarily gifted, don’t disrupt the natural rhythm. For detailed learning methods, please refer to my other article, English Basic Skills.\n","wordCount":"2768","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://atomx.cc/images/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Atom.X"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://atomx.cc/posts/edu/lang/how-to-learn-english/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Atom.X","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://atomx.cc/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://atomx.cc/ accesskey=h title="Atom.X (Alt + H)">Atom.X</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Their houses fill up with mismatched, broken bottles—this is the lifestyle of the poor.</p><p>Many people treat foreign languages and technologies merely as containers, filling them with their own “homemade” additions. Whether in appearance or taste, this hodgepodge often lacks authenticity.</p><p>If the words, phrases, and grammar of a language are like the grains or fruits used to brew a drink, then exploring the deep core of a language—its specific context of philosophy, belief, religion, and theology—is like uncovering the microorganisms and techniques used in brewing. Therefore, a deeper level of language learning should focus on embracing its excellent way of thinking and spirit.</p><p>What you eat and drink determines your social status. In the dark, corrupt society of the past, corrupt officials and cunning businessmen would drink expensive brandy with shark fin, bear paw, or bird’s nest soup; whereas in a civilized society, the elite favor floral teas paired with plant-based proteins as a trend towards low-carbon, eco-friendly lifestyles.</p><p>If you cannot appreciate a particular drink or integrate into its social setting, remember that even after millions of years of evolution, humans—like other organisms—recognize one another by scent. There is a unique, almost intangible form of soft cultural power in that.</p><p>Even a tycoon with several private wine cellars might not appreciate the authentic taste of a renowned European vineyard if he does not belong to that social circle. In contrast, while replicating a bottle or its external packaging is relatively easy, obtaining the authentic brewing materials and the specific microbial fermentation process—developed over decades or even generations in a unique cultural setting—is much harder to imitate. That authenticity becomes part of one’s very marrow.</p><p>This is the insight someone who had attained a deep understanding of Western culture shared with me. As it goes beyond the scope of this article, I will pause here.</p><p>The deeply ingrained mindset of “Chinese learning with Western application” subtly instills a sense of hostility toward foreign cultures—a phenomenon widespread across different nations and regions—in education. This manifests as being “closed off, narrowly confined, and ignorant of the broader world,” which naturally hinders effective learning because it lacks a genuine openness toward other cultures.</p><p>When we left high school, we had studied English for six years and then received an additional two years of English instruction in college—totaling eight years of study. Yet when we started working, like most of my peers, our spoken English was almost non-existent—not even at a basic level. This was partly due to the limited educational conditions in our remote, mountainous K12 schools.</p><p>At that time, the Internet wasn’t developed, and we had little chance to see the outside world. Yet I vaguely sensed that the progress among Westerners was rapid—they had evolved from primitive beginnings into civilized people in no time. Their advancements in science, art, and general social welfare far exceeded the treatment of people in the so-called Third World.</p><p>More importantly, beyond learning a practical tool like a foreign language, it is crucial to understand the real outside world. One must not assume that ready access to Internet information automatically leads to objective understanding.</p><p>How powerful can a long-established, rigid mindset be? Many people have already emigrated overseas, yet even after leaving, they continue to cling to their narrow native mentality. They leave their homeland only to find that, abroad, they still &ldquo;carry their well&rdquo; on their shoulders: unable to speak the local language, uninterested in local news and events, and confined to a narrow social circle of their own nationality. Instead, they pass their time playing mahjong, square dancing in parks, or enjoying street barbecue.</p><p>Yes, they fill foreign containers with their own “home-brew,” resulting in an inauthentic flavor. They may claim admiration for another civilization, but in practice, their lifestyle and mindset never truly integrate into the local society.</p><h1 id=success-mindset>Success Mindset<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#success-mindset>#</a></h1><p>Overcoming one’s inner obstacles is the key to overcoming everything.</p><p>Recently, I was watching a course on learning methods taught by reputed “master teachers” from multiple disciplines including industrial and systems engineering, computer science, neurobiology, brain science, and psychology (which is why extracurricular tutoring centers especially like to recommend renowned teachers to parents). It’s best to watch the entire course. In one of the lessons, the instructor interviewed Benny—a person born with a language learning disability who, through sheer effort, became a polyglot and public speaker. His experience is very enlightening for learning any subject.</p><p>Here’s an interview with “Benny the Irish Polyglot” about how to learn: <a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/L4yKh/optional-interview-with-benny-the-irish-polyglot-about-learning-languages>Optional Interview with &ldquo;Benny the Irish Polyglot&rdquo; about Learning Languages</a></p><p><a href=https://www.fluentin3months.com>Benny’s Website</a></p><p>I deeply agree with the two points Benny shared:</p><ul><li>Fall in love with the language itself rather than just learning a few phrases to show off—without the right attitude, success is hard to achieve.</li><li>Start speaking immediately. It’s far more important to overcome the fear of speaking than to avoid communication. Once you overcome your mental barrier, nothing can stop you.</li></ul><h2 id=overcoming-psychological-barriers>Overcoming Psychological Barriers<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#overcoming-psychological-barriers>#</a></h2><p>Failures and mistakes can take many forms, but the principles of success are always similar.</p><p>This reminds me of another successful language learner from China—Li Yang. They share many similarities: similar memorization methods, the use of body movements and public speaking techniques in teaching, and both overcame psychological barriers and fears to eventually learn multiple foreign languages and become effective speakers.</p><p>I never attended Crazy English training, nor do I enjoy the boisterous style of speaking loudly in public. However, I once listened to one of Mr. Li’s online speeches—it was very compelling. For anyone interested in learning, I recommend listening; self-motivation is essential, as no one else can build your confidence for you.</p><p>We see many people around us who have achieved high levels in foreign languages. Countless successful individuals have shared their learning methods and insights. This is a universal phenomenon—success is less about innate talent and more about effective methods coupled with hard work. I wholeheartedly agree with them. Although my unconventional, self-taught approach left some gaps in my foundational skills, I know that strengthening those fundamentals is essential for further improvement.</p><p>Even though my unorthodox method might seem random, it does follow its own set of rules. Unless you’re extraordinarily gifted, don’t upset the natural rhythm. I have summarized some specific learning methods in another article called <a href=../../../../posts/edu/lang/english-basic-skills/>English Basic Skills</a>.</p><h1 id=the-essence-of-language>The Essence of Language<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-essence-of-language>#</a></h1><blockquote><p><strong>Learning a language doesn’t necessarily require heavy academic thinking; it’s about cultivating interest, feeling, and experience.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Language fundamentally involves listening and speaking—that is, pronunciation—rather than reading, writing, or grammar. Long before humans invented writing systems and books, language already existed. The history of oral communication far predates that of written language, so the initial phase of language learning should focus on pronunciation.</p><p>Pronunciation is a physical exercise involving the muscles of the mouth, chest, and abdomen. While some claim that vibrato or vocal cord vibration isn’t the main secret behind good pronunciation (as many singers and public speakers assert), following natural phonetic rules facilitates memory and spontaneous, fluent speech—as if bypassing conscious thought. This phenomenon is similar to the impromptu skills displayed by accomplished speakers and hosts.</p><p>Due to geographic distribution and even the earth’s rotational forces, for instance, Eastern variants of Japanese have only one nasal sound with more front articulation, producing crisp, staccato sounds reminiscent of a machine gun; whereas Europeans tend to produce deeper, chest-resonated sounds emerging from the throat. Some say this contributes to the production of great tenors and basses—and perhaps even why Vienna, Austria, is renowned as a world music capital. (Why haven’t we seen similarly renowned musicians from Asia? That’s a discussion for another time.)</p><p>Perhaps regional phonetic characteristics are influenced by planetary forces—a notion I sometimes ponder while gazing at a globe.</p><p>Not only for learning English—across every language I’ve encountered, the basic ability required does not rely on logical reasoning. Unlike subjects such as mathematics, physics, or chemistry, learning languages is more akin to practicing music, dance, art, sewing, cooking, or masonry—skills that do not necessarily require formal education but are honed through experience.</p><p>There’s nothing mysterious about language. At the basic level, simply following its phonetic rules and practicing repeatedly is enough. Some might say my English is good, but compared to a native speaker—even a person who is illiterate or has cognitive challenges—my listening and speaking skills pale in comparison. In other words, fundamental language ability is not strictly tied to one’s level of formal education or IQ.</p><p>As social beings, humans developed language over hundreds of thousands or even millions of years—a natural ability that doesn’t require formal teaching. A hundred years ago, during mass migrations, people managed to communicate and survive in environments where the language was entirely different.</p><p>Language is an innate talent, just like other natural abilities found in animals. As long as one is exposed to a language-rich environment, they will absorb the language naturally. In most cases, acquiring basic communication skills does not require extra teaching or reinforcement.</p><h1 id=language-environment>Language Environment<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#language-environment>#</a></h1><p>First, we must be grateful to have been born in a wonderful era. Although physical migration is not completely free, the Internet and modern communication tools allow most people to create their own virtual language environment.</p><h2 id=immersive-learning-environment>Immersive Learning Environment<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#immersive-learning-environment>#</a></h2><p>No matter where you are, the most direct way to build a language environment is to change the channels through which you receive and send information. For example, set your computer and mobile device operating systems to a foreign language, use Google (or Microsoft’s international Bing if Google isn’t available) instead of a native search engine.</p><p>Switch all your music, radio, and TV channels to foreign language stations. When I first needed to improve my spoken language skills for work, I used to sleep with a radio playing in a foreign language. In the morning, even if I didn’t understand everything, the monotonous sentences acted like a lullaby. Gradually, as I began to understand more, my overall feel for the language—a sort of “language sense”—started to develop.</p><p>Language sense is an experiential form of understanding that’s hard to describe. Every native language is subconsciously acquired during the early, unformed stages of brain development—even those who never attended school form this instinct.</p><h2 id=cross-cultural-exchange>Cross-Cultural Exchange<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cross-cultural-exchange>#</a></h2><p>A further step in immersive learning is engaging in cross-cultural exchanges—the best way to truly learn a language. If you lack the means to travel, you can invite international tutors or cultural exchange partners to come and “service” you.</p><p>Thanks to the Internet, there are now convenient platforms in China such as Couchsurfing, Hospitality Club, Helpx, and WWOOF. With these work-for-accommodation platforms, you can host international backpackers who in exchange for a few hours of language practice each day, help you improve. After months of intensive practice, you’ll find it almost impossible not to start speaking. Of course, you need to know how to use these platforms to advertise your need.</p><p>If you have the means, you might also consider traveling as a backpacker. Not only does this lower travel costs, but it also allows you to deeply experience the local culture—intensive interaction with foreign tutors becomes a daily exercise. It’s best to do this before the age of 30, as many developed countries offer Working Holiday Visas (WHV) specifically for young people to work and travel.</p><p>I believe that even someone who has only completed high school has the basic foreign language and computer skills needed to build an immersive learning environment. Unfortunately, many friends who asked me for advice on learning English ended up being university graduates; those with lower educational backgrounds rarely even consider learning a foreign language. This reflects not only a problem with the English curriculum but a broader misalignment between our outdated education system and real-life needs.</p><p>I plan to write another article in the future to introduce the concept of a gap year and Working Holiday Visas, as well as the impact that differing cultural and educational systems between China and other countries have on young people. Personally, I carved out my own unconventional path because I stepped outside the traditional system.</p><h1 id=learning-steps>Learning Steps<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#learning-steps>#</a></h1><p>Most people learn English the same way I did—attending training classes and school courses—but I couldn’t absorb the material that way. I ended up wasting both money and time with minimal progress, so I eventually decided to follow my own instincts. Surprisingly, this unorthodox approach allowed me to develop a good language sense; my listening and speaking skills gradually became fluent. Although vocabulary and grammar remained my weak points—especially since those are the specialties of classmates from formal language programs—I rarely needed the advanced vocabulary or grammatical structures taught in higher-level courses.</p><p>Without a solid foundation, any skyscraper built in the air will eventually collapse. Even though I’ve passed the beginner stage, I still feel my foundation is not yet strong enough. Any further improvement will require reinforcing the basics.</p><p>What may seem like a random, unconventional approach actually follows certain rules. Unless you’re extraordinarily gifted, don’t disrupt the natural rhythm.
