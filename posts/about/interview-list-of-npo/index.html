I have collected many news sources related to environment, animals, and plant products.\nWhy are you interested in this project? I have been engaged in environmental protection, agricultural products, and food e-commerce for the past 10 years. I have been deeply exploring environmental, animal, and health issues behind food. I am very familiar with these discourses and have taken many open classes.\nWhat is your proudest accomplishment in life so far? I understand IT technology, can build ladders to climb over the wall, have a broad vision, improve cognition, have freedom of information and abundant spiritual thoughts, have independent thinking and deep insight into society and life, have faith and continue to act (although almost all have been frustrated by the real environment)\nPlease share how you usually spend your day from morning to night. I spent much time in a farmyard of China Hangzhou suburb since 3 years ago, very regular lives by bio-clock.\nGood morning\n6:30 - 7:00 am\nI wake up naturally and then go to the bathroom on time every day, no exception holiday.\nUsually, I talk to myself, thank GOD, I am still alive, can hear birds twitter, watch green land and feel warm about SUN, I have more luck than most other people and animals.\nWork and study\n7:00am - 9:00pm\nPower on my laptop and start a new day work, and talk to co-workers till afternoon, then study new MOOCs after super.\nI stand up from my chair once every hour and deal with housework, telephone and go to bathroom etc. sometimes I may stand up once for 2 hours for the emergency task.\n2.5 meals a day\n9:00- 10:00 am, brunch, fresh food cooked totally by myself once a day ;\n2:00- 2:30 pm, tea break, snacks and cookies fast food, no-cook and fire;\n5:30- 6:30 pm, supper, just heat the left food of brunch, easy and fast;\nGood night\n10:30 pm\nI end up a day by kindle or radio of any kind story, I listen to bible story with my family recently.\nUsually, fall to sleep no more than 15 minutes after lying down on the pillow, I always have good quality sleep.\nBesides\nI will go for 1-hour outdoor activity each day after supper or tea break usually, while the weather is good ;\nWatching an online movie once every weekend after supper ;\nAnticipating online church weekend worship every Sunday morning at 10:00- 11:30 am;\nWhat kind of job do you want? Is it possible to achieve it in 5 years? Remote work that is not limited by time and space, no need to commute in the urban area every day. It has been realized in the past year, but the effect is not very good. Because most of the companies served are accustomed to face-to-face communication and collaboration, they inevitably need to run on the spot. The habit of online collaboration for all people is yet to come.\nIdeally, how many hours per week would you like to work? My current work and study rhythm exceeds 60 hours/week, and it is acceptable to take only one day off per week. Thank goodness if it’s less than 60 hours!\nWhat is your minimum salary requirement for this position? In the initial stage, it is enough to ensure survival. For example, the average project team member in first-tier cities in China (Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou) needs 5000-7000rmb per month, and 800-3000rmb is also acceptable in second- to eighth-tier cities and towns. The key is that the project is interesting and socially valuable. Money is not the main issue. If it is attractive enough, we can invest some money ourselves.\nAssuming your life goal is to make as much money as possible in the next 5 years, please write 2-3 paragraphs describing how you would make money and the chances of success. Frankly speaking, I don’t think we can get money from an ideal job, such as non-profits projects, environment and animal welfare etc. I have been working for many years as a volunteer in China mainland, lots of friends even have serious survival problems if they only have non- profits’ jobs.\nSo, I develop many IT skills that can get a good income in the current HR market from other businesses, but not non-profits’ sectors, I always try to find a good solution but haven’t found it yet.\nLet’s take a deep insight through the whole imperfect industry chain, there are huge niche markets and opportunities over there. From the Upstream, Agriculture land of raw material, Manufactures for deep processing; Middle stream, Packaging, warehousing and logistics; to Downstream, E-commerce, marketing, media etc., every section need us to do IT, computing and more efficient network service, that’s what I good at.\nTo get more people business together is the key point of success, we need the so-called traditional Chinese GUANXI (关系 relationship) is very complicated, it always makes me bored and hard, many young people are not good at it either, but somebody is very good at establishing new Guanxi(business rules), not the traditional old one.\nWe can cooperate to solve it and get good profits together.\n","wordCount":"887","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://atomx.cc/images/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"2019-11-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2019-11-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Atom.X"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://atomx.cc/posts/about/interview-list-of-npo/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Atom.X","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://atomx.cc/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body
