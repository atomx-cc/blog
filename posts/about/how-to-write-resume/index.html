Please save time on socializing. Online resumes are the most important efficiency tool and an important indicator of the level of modern civilization development of certain ethnic groups.\nWhy is a resume important? Among the people I know from over 100 countries, everyone in developed countries has an online resume, usually on Linkedin, and many of them have personal websites or businesses. Citizens of the top 20 countries in the world generally have personal profile pages starting from junior high school.\nHowever, people from relatively backward or developing regions such as China, Ukraine, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa, more than 90% of them probably do not have resumes, no matter what age group they are in, even many people with bachelor’s or master’s degrees do not have resumes, which means they may have never looked for a job independently, or they simply do not have a job, or they get a job through acquaintances. These countries or regions are often relatively backward in development.\nWhy is a resume important?\nFor me, a resume can save time on socializing. I don’t want to waste time repeating the same questions with people I just met, face-to-face or online countless times:\nWho are you?\nWhere are you from?\nWhere are you going?\nWhat do you do?\nWhat is your ideal?\nWhat is your major?\nWhat have you experienced?\n…\nIn order to solve the above problems efficiently, I only need half a day to write a personal profile and post it on my webpage. In the future, if anyone has similar questions, I will just send them the link to read it themselves.\nIf we meet people who are not even willing to read a few paragraphs of text, or who cannot summarize and communicate in words, do not interact with them, because their basic qualities are not enough for normal communication, or they have not yet integrated into modern society, and talking to them is a waste of time.\nIn this way, we can filter our circle of friends and get rid of unnecessary relationships.\nA resume is just the most basic and simplest personal introduction, mainly used in the workplace. To really understand a person’s background, a resume alone is far from enough.\nIn reality, we work with colleagues in the unit, or live with neighbors for several years. You have seen their resumes, but you may still feel that these people are familiar strangers.\nThis is not a good thing. We cannot just be a working machine, working for money. As human beings, we must be able to perceive the surrounding environment in order to survive and develop better and prevent unexpected risks. We must understand more background information about ourselves and the people around us, especially people’s personalities and habits. Of course, this belongs to the extended version of the resume, which is derived from the resume.\nHowever, many people do not even understand themselves. You can test it immediately by asking them to write a personal summary.\nExceptions If in the 21st century, someone still asks the silly question “Why write a resume?”, don’t bother with them, unless they have exceptional circumstances - never been educated or disabled.\nSince nearly half of the world’s countries and regions are backward and developing, unfortunately, there are still many people who have not received education, cannot read or write, and cannot use network equipment;\nThere are also people with disabilities who are physically challenged and may not be able to use their eyes and hands to read and write, and do not have the conditions to directly use information tools. These special circumstances can be helped by friends around them or public welfare organizations.\nI have also met many people with disabilities who have learned to use information tools, have their own websites and businesses, and have achieved something.\nOther than that, everyone else must abide by the general rules of social interaction, otherwise they themselves have some problems, such as psychological barriers (reading, writing, communication, expression, social interaction) and so on.\nResume leaking privacy? The first time I heard “resume leaking privacy”, I laughed out loud. Is this a spy war? Or primitive society? This sentence was said by a young Ukrainian man, of course she has graduated from college, which also gives a glimpse of the quality of education in Ukraine.\nSome people do get into trouble and have such concerns because they don’t know how to use internet tools.\nBecause the technology of using a knife is not good, and I am worried that the knife will cut my hand, some people will not have good food to eat, but fresh and delicious meat, fruits, and vegetables need to be processed with a knife. Everything has two sides. If you know a little bit of technology, you can avoid disadvantages and seek advantages.\nIf you can distinguish between public and private, shield the private part, do not open it to other strangers, or can withdraw it at any time, there will be no leakage problem.\nIf you don’t know how to operate, you can consult me.\nHow to write a resume? Just fill it out according to the resume template. There are many excellent resume platform recommendations:\nGlobal human resources platform created in Silicon Valley, USA Linkedin\nSuitable for development in continental Europe Europass\nSuitable for development in developed countries and regions such as North America, Europe and Japan Indeed\nHuman Resources Platform for the Eastern Provinces of Canada Novascotia\nIf you feel like you are a blank slate and don’t know how to write, go to these platforms to see tutorials and guides, and refer to other people’s resumes.\nMore importantly, spend time studying and working hard, accumulating work experience and various skill certificates, and then the resume will naturally be enriched. No one is born with all the knowledge and life experience.\nIf you want a good life and income, but don’t want to put in the effort to achieve it, and don’t even know how to introduce yourself, then there is really no hope in life.\nIntroduce yourself Finally, refer to my personal webpage: About Atom\nThere are also some more interesting and richer ways of personal introduction, personality tests and questionnaires, such as: Proust Questionnaire\n","wordCount":"1046","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://atomx.cc/images/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"2022-02-03T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-02-03T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Atom.X"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://atomx.cc/posts/about/how-to-write-resume/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Atom.X","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://atomx.cc/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://atomx.cc/ accesskey=h title="Atom.X (Alt + H)">Atom.X</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
