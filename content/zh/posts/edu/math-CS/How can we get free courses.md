# Why Financial aid

In the past few years, due to the Corona virus, I fleet away from China, and created agriculture business in Ukraine, then had to leave for Europe, now I am an asylum seeker, studying and looking for a new survival opportunities.

In the past many years, I only focused on my work and was not interested in politics and wars, until the corona virus, my basic survival was threatened, as a common people, there are too much things that I don't know.

After I have paid heavily bloody cost, I found the truth that, the whole world is operated in blackbox, it is totally a political performance conflict.

So, I decide to study and load more knowledge to my brain heavily, and make myself more strong and independently.

I did not have the opportunity to receive a good education in China, but luckily that I was not poisoned by too much institutional education.

The traditional style school education costs and requirements are both too high, so I seek for online courses.

## **How will your selected course help with your goals?**

My farm job is easily affected by force majeure factors, such as war, natural disasters etc., nobody pay for my lost, there is no insurance or basic social security to farm worker in an un-developing country such as Ukraine and China.

But I love farm and country life, so I have to practice more remote skills, and the best options would be programming and data technology. Thanks to the great age of information technology, when our offline existence in the real world cannot continue, we have other online options to move forward.

Based on my professional background and interests, I decided to start with basic mathematics knowledge, and then the topics of remote technical courses were mainly: Python, data science, cyber security, computer science.
