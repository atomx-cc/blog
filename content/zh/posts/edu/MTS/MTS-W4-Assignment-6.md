1. ¬ [$∃x$A(x)] = $∀x$[¬A(x)] ?

¬ [$∃x$A(x)]

if it is not the case that at least a x satisfies A(x), 

then for all x are not not satisfy A(x),

so for all x, ¬A(x) is true.

$∀x$[¬A(x)] 

2. Prove false

*There is an even prime bigger than 2*

x are parts of natural number set $N$, Prime number P(x), Even number E(x)

$∃x$[E(x)P(x)∧(x>2)]

¬ {$∃x$[E(x)P(x)∧(x>2)]} is True

$∀x$[E(x)P(x) ⇒ (2≥ x)]

As we known when 2≥ x, the all prime numbers are even. because the only is 2. 

so this statement is true.

in other word, it means 

$∃x$[E(x)P(x)∧(x>2)] is false.

**De Morgan’s Law**

¬(φ ∨ ψ )  ⇔ ¬ φ ∧ ¬ψ 

¬(φ ∧ ψ )  ⇔ ¬ φ ∨ ¬ψ 

$¬ ∃x$E(x)P(x) ∨ $¬ ∃x$E(x)(x>2)

$¬ ∃x$E(x)P(x) ∨ $¬ ∃x$E(x)(x≤2)

# 8. Abraham Lincoln sentence negation

People p, Fool F(p,t), Time t 

$∃t$$∀p$ F$(p,t)$  ∧ $∃p$$∀t$ F$(p,t)$  ∧ ¬[$∀p$ $∀t$ F$(p,t)$ ]

¬ { }

$∃p$$∀t$¬ F$(p,t)$  ∨ $∃t$$∀p$ ¬F$(p,t)$  ∨ $∀p$$∀t$F$(p,t)$ 

You can not fool some of the people all the time, 

or you can not fool all of the people sometime.

or you can fool all of the people all the time.

# 9. Negation of a function

(∀ε > 0)(∃δ > 0)(∀x)[|x − a| < δ ⇒ |f(x) − f(a)| < ε]

¬ { (∀ε > 0)(∃δ > 0)(∀x)[|x − a| < δ ⇒ |f(x) − f(a)| < ε] }

($∃ε$ > 0)($∀δ$ > 0)($∃x$)[|x − a| < δ ∧ |f(x) − f(a)| ≥ ε]

implication law

¬(φ ⇒ ψ)  ⇔  φ ∧ ¬ψ

φ ⇒ ψ  ⇔  ¬φ ∨ ψ

# Quiz - Problem set

1. (b) $∀p∀q∃t$W$(p,q,t)$, False

people p, q, tennis game t, p wins q in a game.

interpret, everyone could win everyone in some games, for  $∀p∀q$, it means  p=q, including all people, people can not beat themselves in a game.

so it is False.

1. Euclid’s proof of the infinitude of the primes.

If integer N is divisible by a Prime P, then N+1 is not be divisible by P.

integer N, Prime P, integer Q

N = PQ

Assume N+1 could be divisible by P, get integer R

N+1 = PR

1= PR- PQ

1=P(R-Q)
