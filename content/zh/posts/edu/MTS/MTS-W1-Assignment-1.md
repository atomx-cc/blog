# Truth table

∧ conjunction 合取: anyone is false, φ ∧ ψ will be false

∨ disjunction 析取: anyone is truth, φ ∨ ψ will be truth.

φ: phi 

ψ: psi

θ: Theta

## Quiz

True table game, triary logic

(φ ∧ ψ) ∧ θ = φ ∧ (ψ ∧ θ)

| φ | T | T | F | F |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ψ | T | F(1) | T(2) | F |
| φ ∧ ψ | T | F(1) | F(2) | F |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| ψ | T | T(2) | F(1) | F |
| θ | T | F(2) | T(1) | F |
| ψ ∧ θ | T | F | F | F |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| (φ ∧ ψ) ∧ θ | T | F(1) | F(2) | F |
| φ ∧ (ψ ∧ θ) | T | F | F | F |

When calculate triary logic , mark a number(1 or 2) in each block , and must always track the same number for each calculation.

eg. (φ ∧ ψ) ∧ θ =  (φ ∧ ψ)`F(1)` ∧ θ`T(1)` = `F(1)`

(φ ∨ ψ) ∨ θ = φ ∨ (ψ ∨ θ)  

(φ ∨ ψ) ∧ θ = (φ ∧ θ) ∨ (ψ ∧ θ)  

(φ ∧ ψ) ∨ θ = (φ ∧ θ) ∨ (ψ ∧ θ)
