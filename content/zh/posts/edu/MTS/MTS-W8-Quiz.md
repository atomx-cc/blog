**least upper bound**

A set A of reals can have at most one least upper bound.

if a is LUB, then a≤b

if b is LUB, then b≤a

if a, b are both two LUBs, then b=a, 

such as {42} has the only element 42 as both an upper bound and a lower bound.

**lower bound**

if a set A of reals has a lower bound, it has infinitely many lower bounds. 

if a is a lower bound of A, then so is any b<a.

**Set of reals is infinite** 

if a set A of reals has both a lower bound and an upper bound, then it is infinite.

i.e. let A=[0,1], it is an infinite set of real numbers.

**Least upper bound of integers set**

-1 is the least upper bound of the set of negative integers, considered as a subset of the reals. 

the set of negative integers {…… n, -3, -2, -1}

**Sandwich Theorem(Squeeze Theorem)**

the Sandwich Theorem say that

if $\left\{{a_n}\right\}_{\left(n=1\right)}^∞$, $\left\{{b_n}\right\}_{\left(n=1\right)}^∞$, $\left\{{c_n}\right\}_{\left(n=1\right)}^∞$ are sequences such that, 

from some point $n_0$ onwards, $a_n$ ≤ $b_n$ ≤ $c_n$, 

and if  $\lim _{n→∞}a_n$ =  $L$ , $\lim _{n→∞}c_n$ =  $L$ 

then $\left\{{b_n}\right\}_{\left(n=1\right)}^∞$ is convergent, and $\lim _{n→∞}b_n$ =  $L$ 

how to prove by the Sandwich Theorem ?

Theorem  $\lim _{n→∞}$$\frac{\left(\sin n\right)^{2\ }}{3^n}$ = 0

proof: for any n,  0≤$\frac{\left(\sin n\right)^{2\ }}{3^n}$ ≤ $\frac{1\ }{3^n}$

clearly, $\lim _{n→∞}$$\frac{1\ }{3^n}$ = 0 

0≤$\frac{\left(\sin n\right)^{2\ }}{3^n}$ ≤ 0

hence by the Sandwich Theorem, 

$\lim _{n→∞}$$\frac{\left(\sin n\right)^{2\ }}{3^n}$ = 0

as required.

1. $(∃m∈ N)(∃n∈ N)(3m+5n=12)$

Answer: this statement is false.

Prove: set *n*=2, the closer possible solution is m=1, then 3m+5n=13;

if n>2, then 3m+5n>13; 

set m=2, the closer possible solution is n =, then 3m+5n=11;

if m>2, then 3m+5n>11, but never could be 12 by natural number; 

There doe not exist nature number n, m that satisfy the equation.

$(¬∃m ∈ N) (¬∃n ∈ N)$(3m+5n=12)

So, it is proved.

1. **The sum of any five consecutive integers is divisible by 5 (without remainder).**

Answer: the statement is True.

Prove: set (*n* ∈ *Z*), n could be anyone of the integer set,

the sequence of any five consecutive integers are:
$*n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4*$

The sum of above numbers sequence:
$Σ(n,n+1,n+2,n+3,n+4)=  5n+10 = 5(n+2)$

obviously, 5(n+2) is divisible by 5.

The statement is proved.

1. **For any integer *n*, the number $*n^2+ n +1$*  is odd.**

Answer: the statement is True.

Prove: by induction

set n =1, then **$*n^2+ n +1$***  = 3, it is odd.

Assume for any integer n, it is true.

$∀n[A(n)⇒A(n+1)]$

set n = n+1, then  $(n+1)^2+(n+1)+1=n^2+3n+3=(n^2+n+1)+2(n+1)$

clearly that  2(*n*+1) is even or zero, and **$*n^2+ n +1$***   is odd,

when number odd add even(or zero), it could only produce odd possibly,

so it is proved.

1.  **every odd natural number is of one of the forms 4*n*+1 or 4*n*+3, where *n* is an integer.**

Answer: the statement is true.

Prove: by induction 
set (*n* ∈ *Z*), n could be anyone of the integers.
when n=0, 4n+1=1, 4n+3=3; 
when n=1, 4n+1=5, 4n+3=7;

{1, 3, 5, 7} are odd natural numbers.

Assume for any integer n, it is true.

$∀n[A(n)⇒A(n+1)]$

set n = n+1, then the forms are  4(*n*+1)+1,4(*n*+1)+3

4(*n*+1)+1=(4*n*+1)+4,4(*n*+1)+3=(4*n*+3)+4

clearly that  any number odd add an even number 4, it could only produce odd possibly,

so, it is proved.

1. **for any integer *n*, at least one of the integers *n, n*+2, *n*+4 is divisible by 3.**

Answer: 

~~the statement is true.(the prompt does not require to answer true or false)~~

Prove: by the division theorem. ~~by induction(the main method is not induction).~~

set n=1, n+2= 1x3 ; n=2, n+4 = 2x3, so on, etc.

assume for any integer *n*, the statement is true.

set n=3k, then **n** is divisible by 3;

set n=3k+1, then ***n*+2=3(k+1)** is divisible by 3;

set n=3k+2, then ***n*+4=3(k+2)** is divisible by 3;

for n = n+1, 

**the integers *n+1, n*+3, *n*+5** 

set n=3k, then ***n*+3=** **3(k+1)** is divisible by 3;

set n=3k+1, then ***n*+5=3(k+2)** is divisible by 3;

set n=3k+2, then ***n*+1=3(k+1)** is divisible by 3;

by reasoning they are all divisible by 3

It is proved.

1. **prove the only prime triple (i.e. three primes, each 2 from the next) is 3, 5, 7.**

by contradiction

Assume there are more prime triples.

set the prime triples are P, P+2, P+4

and set P is the set of Prime.

when P=3, the prime triple is **3, 5, 7.**

according to question 5: **for any integer *n*, at least one of the integers *n, n*+2, *n*+4 is divisible by 3.**

except  P=3, the other all results will get sets that could be divisible by 3, 

so they are not prime.

it proves the only prime triple is **3, 5, 7.**

1. **Prove that for any natural number $2^2+2^2+2^3+…+2^n=2^(n+1)−2$**

Prove: by induction.

set n = 1 , left side is 2, left side is 2, they are equal to each other.

Assume for any integer n, it is true.

$∀n[A(n)⇒A(n+1)]$

set n = n+1,  for left side of euqation: 

**$2^2+2^2+2^3+…+2^n+2^(n+1)$ =**

$2^(n+1)−2 +2^(n+1)$ = $2[2^(n+1)−1]$

for the right side of equation:
$2^((n+1)+1)−2=2[2^(n+1)]−2=2[2^(n+1)−1]$

both sides are equal to each other.

So it is proved

1. **the sequence $\left\{Ma_n\right\}_{n=1}^{\ ∞}$ tends to the limit $ML.$** 

Prove:  

give 𝜀>0,

$lim _{n→∞}a_n =  L$ , $M>0$

set |A| = | $\left\{a_n\right\}_{n=1}^{\ ∞}$ $−L$ | < 𝜀

such that |A| <  𝜀/𝑀

 $M |A|$ <  𝜀,  $|MA|$ <  𝜀, 

 | $\left\{Ma_n\right\}_{n=1}^{\ ∞}$ $−ML$ | < 𝜀

by the definition of limts.(very important for the conclusion statement)

hence, it proves the sequence $\left\{Ma_n\right\}_{n=1}^{\ ∞}$ tends to the limit $ML.$ 

1. **Prove that your example has the stated property.**

${∩}_(n=1) ^∞$$∩_(n=1) ^∞$ *An*= { ${x∣(∀n)(x∈An)}$ }

Prove :

∩𝑛=1∞𝐴𝑛=∩^∞_{𝑛=1}𝐴_𝑛 = 
 
 ∩n=1∞An= { x∣(∀n)(x∈An)x|(∀n) (x ∈ An)x∣(∀n)(x∈An) }

set  x=1/nx= 1/n  x=1/n

∩𝑛=1∞𝐴𝑛=∩^∞_{𝑛=1}𝐴_𝑛 = 
 
 ∩n=1∞An= { x∣(∀n)(x∈An)x  |(∀n) (x ∈ An)x∣(∀n)(x∈An) }

so AnAnAn = (  0,10, 10,1],

set  x=1/(n+1)x= 1/(n+1)  x=1/(n+1),
∩𝑛=1∞𝐴(𝑛+1)=∩^∞_{𝑛=1}𝐴_(𝑛+1) = 
 
 ∩n=1∞A(n+1)= { x∣(∀(n+1)[x∈A(n+1)]x  |(∀(n+1) [x ∈ A(n+1)]x∣(∀(n+1)[x∈A(n+1)] } ,

A(n+1)A(n+1)A(n+1) =  (  0,1/20, 1/20,1/2],

1/(n+1)<1/n1/(n+1) < 1/n 1/(n+1)<1/n,  1/2<1 1/2 < 11/2<1,

so  A(n+1)⊂AnA_(n+1) ⊂ A_nA(n+1)⊂An

When take n as a big number,

∩𝑛=1∞𝐴𝑛∩^∞_{𝑛=1}𝐴_𝑛
 
 ∩n=1∞An =  ∩𝑛=1∞A(n+1)∩^∞_{𝑛=1}A(n+1)
 
 ∩n=1∞A(n+1) =  ( 0, 0)  =∅= ∅=∅
so  A(n+1)=AnA_(n+1) =  A_nA(n+1)=An

it proves that for all nnn and ∩𝑛=1∞𝐴𝑛=∅∩^∞_{𝑛=1}𝐴_𝑛=∅
 
 ∩n=1∞An=∅

such that  A(n+1)⊂AnA_(n+1) ⊂ A_nA(n+1)⊂An


1. **Prove that your example has the stated property.**

Prove:

n∈Zn ∈ Zn∈Z, A(n+1)⊂AnA_(n+1) ⊂ A_nA(n+1)⊂An

set  x=0nx=\frac{0}{n}x=n0 ,

for ∩𝑛=1∞𝐴𝑛=∩^∞_{𝑛=1}𝐴_𝑛 =
 
 
 ∩n=1∞An=   {(x∣(∀n)(x∈An) (x |(∀n) (x ∈ An)(x∣(∀n)(x∈An) }

for any n, and n+1, x=0,

such that  ∩𝑛=1∞𝐴𝑛∩^∞_{𝑛=1}𝐴_𝑛
 
 ∩n=1∞An ={0}

it is the single real number in the set

so it is proved.
