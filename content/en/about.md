# **Current**

As of March 2024, I live in a small town of Central Europe, studying new emerging technologies of computers and the internet, doing part time remote jobs of programming. In the meantime, I have the honor to assist missionaries' preaching services in the local church.

I am also a part-time farmer, involves herding (horses, cows, sheep, shepherd dogs, and bees), growing organic fruits and vegetables, maintaining garden landscapes, fixing houses, taking care of children, etc., A very interesting and healthy way of life that perfectly balances physical and mental work.


# **Past**

Before the Russian-Ukrainian War in February 2022, I operated farm business for investors in Central Ukraine. After more than a year of unsettled lives, I went to Europe seeking for survival opportunities.

Before going overseas in 2020, I had been engaged in agricultural product e-commerce operation for 10 years. I worked for several leading Internet companies in China, and am familiar with the fresh food supply chain industry. Due to my work, I have participated in countless social activities on environmental issues and have served many environmental protection and agricultural non-profit organizations.


# **Future**

In recent years, with the pandemics and war, I have often felt a strong sense of crisis. In order to cope with the unpredictable, destructive, and inevitable disasters and social chaos in the future, it is necessary to be prepared for the worst situation:

> Think of danger in times of safety;
> Disaster Recovery;
> Load balancing;
> Multi-Site High Availability(Active-Active across multiple locations), several live places in urban and rural areas;

Looking for business partners: Create shared offices and living spaces with garden and farm for remote working partners, develop software and online businesses that are beneficial to society.
