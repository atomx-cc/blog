### Currently

- In January 2025  

I live in a peaceful town in Central Europe, working remotely on AI and cloud computing operations. I am also studying several courses in mathematics, computer science, and cognitive science.  

Part-time farming includes herding (horses, cattle, sheep, sheepdogs, bees), planting organic fruits and vegetables, maintaining garden landscapes, repairing houses, and taking care of children. The balance between physical and mental labor is evenly split, this is a very interesting and healthy lifestyle.

### Past

- In February 2022, before the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war

I was managing a farm in central Ukraine, experiencing over a year of displacement and unrest. I moved westward to the heart of Europe, passing through many beautiful ancient towns, meeting people from various ethnicities and cultural backgrounds.

- In 2020, before moving to Europe

I spent ten years in the agricultural e-commerce industry, working for multiple leading internet companies' agricultural departments in China. I was involved in platform development and operation management, familiar with organic agriculture and fresh food supply chains. Additionally, I served as a management consultant and trainer for dozens of agricultural enterprises.

I participated in countless social activities for non-profit organizations, providing services such as data analysis, project research, and operational management for 10+ environmental protection, agricultural development, and related think tanks.

- In 2010, before joining Agriculture industry

For four years, I worked as an English translator and IT assistant at the Beijing Foreign Affairs Reception Department, serving diplomatic missions, foreign enterprises, the Olympics, international schools, and branches of the United Nations. I provided support for major cultural and tourism events involving international organizations.

## Future

With the outbreak of pandemics, wars, economic crises, and other issues, we often feel a sense of crisis in recent years. The macro environment may force many people to change their lifestyles. People may have to move away from big cities and modern civilization. When commercial economies become unreliable, self-sufficiency becomes necessary. To prepare for unpredictable, catastrophic, or irresistible disasters and social chaos, it is essential to always be ready for the worst-case scenario:

> Prepare for danger in times of safety, think ahead, and have disaster recovery plans in place.

We are looking for partners who share our values, exploring diverse global social environments, creating communities/gardens/farms/offices/living spaces, using IT and multilingual skills to enhance traditional industries.

We enjoy collaborating with partners who look towards the future, refuse mediocrity, maintain a positive attitude, strive for progress, fulfill social responsibilities, and explore life and career paths together.

Looking forward to a bright and harmonious future!
