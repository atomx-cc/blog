(c) (x>5)∧(x<7), 5<x<7

(d) (x<4)∧(x<6), x<4

(e) $(y<4)∧(y^2 <9), y^2<9$

(f) (x≥0)∧(x≤0), x=0

# 2. Express each of your simplified statements from question 1 in natural English.

(b) p is greater than or equal to 7 and less than 12.

(c) x is greater than 5, and less than 7.

(d) x is less than 4

(e) y squared is less than 9

(f) x is equal to 0

# 3. What strategy would you adopt to show that the conjunction φ1 ∧ φ2 ∧ . . . ∧ φn is true?

show that all of φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φn are true

# 4. What strategy would you adopt to show that the conjunction φ1 ∧ φ2 ∧ . . . ∧ φn is false?

show that one of φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φn is false.

# 5. Simplify the symbolic statements

(a) (π>3)∨(π>10), π>3
(b) (x<0)∨(x>0), x≠0
(c) (x=0)∨(x>0), x≥0
(d) (x>0)∨(x≥0), x≥0
(e) (x>3)∨($x^2$ >9), $x^2$ >9

# 6. Express the above symbolic statements in natural English.

(a) π is greater than 3

(b) x is not equal to 0

(c) x is equal to or greater than 0

(d) x is equal to or greater than 0

(e) x squared is greater than 9

# 7. What strategy would you adopt to show that the disjunction φ1 ∨ φ2 ∨ . . . ∨ φn is true?

show that one of φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φn is true

# 8. What strategy would you adopt to show that the disjunction φ1 ∨ φ2 ∨ . . . ∨ φn is false?

show that all φ1 , φ2 , . . . , φn are false

# 9. Simplify the symbolic statements

(a) ¬(π > 3.2), π ≤ 3.2
(b) ¬(x < 0), x ≥ 0
(c) ¬($x^2$ > 0), x = 0 
(d) ¬(x = 1), x≠1
(e) ¬¬ψ, ψ

# 10. Express the above symbolic statements in natural English.

(a) negation of / not the case that Pai is greater than 3.2, Pai is less than and equal to 3.2
(b) negation of / not the case that x is less than 0, x is greater than and equal to 0
(c) negation of / not the case that x squared is greater than 0, x is equal to 0
(d) negation of / not the case that x equal to 1, x not equal to 1
(e) double negation of / not the case that ψ(Psi), ψ

# 11. Express in logical notation

(a) D ∧ Y

(b) ¬Y ∧ T ∧ D

(c) ¬(Y ∧ D)

(d) T ∧ ¬Y ∧ ¬D

(e) ¬T ∧ Y ∧ D

# DISCUSS

## Guilty and Proven

Truth Table, Binary logic, True or False

| G | P | G ∧ P |  | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T | ✔︎ | Correctly Proven Guilty |
| T | F | F | ✘ | Incorrectly Proven Innocent |
| F | T | F | ✘ | Incorrectly Proven Guilty |
| F | F | F | ✔︎ | Correctly Proven Innocent |

## Not disPleased

Not disPleased is neutral, this is not a binary logic but a triary logic

triary logic

| **Positive** | **neutral** | **Negative** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pleased | not displeased | disPleased |
| Pleased | ¬(¬ pleased)
 | ¬ pleased
 |

¬ *pleased = displeased*

¬ *displeased* ≠ *pleased*

¬ *pleased* < ¬ ( ¬ *pleased*) < pleased
