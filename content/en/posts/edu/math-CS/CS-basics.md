[IaaS vs. PaaS vs. SaaS](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/iaas-paas-saas)

| **Service Model** | **Explanation** | **Service Content** | Analogy **Case** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IaaS  | Infrastructure as a Service | Typically provides access to networking capabilities, computers (virtual or dedicated hardware), and data storage space | Buy a car and drive it yourself |
| PaaS  | Platform as a Service | You don't need to manage the underlying infrastructure (typically hardware and operating system), allowing you to focus more on application deployment and management | Rent a car and drive it yourself |
| SaaS  | Software as a Service | Complete product, providing end-user applications | Call a taxi service |
