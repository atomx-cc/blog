[Stars Example](https://www.coursera.org/learn/writing-running-fixing-code/supplement/UCjM3/stars-example)


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int printTriangle(int size)
{
//start with starCount being 0
int starCount = 0;
//count from 0 (inclusive) to size (exclusive), for each number i that you count
for (int i=0; i< size; i++)
		{ 
//count from 0 (inclusive) to i (inclusive), for each number j that you count
 for (int j=0; j<=i; j++)
				 {
    //print a "*"
    printf("*");

    //increment starCount
    starCount++;
				  }

 //when you finish counting on j,
 //print a newline ("\\n")
 printf("\\n");
		}
//when you finish counting on i,
//your answer is starCount
return starCount;
}

int main(void)
{
int numStars;
printf("Here is a triangle with height 4\n");
numStars = printTriangle(4);
printf("That triangle had %d total stars\n", numStars);
//now print "Here is a triangle with height 7\n"
//then call printTriangle, passing in 7, and assign the result to numStars
//finally, print "That triangle had %d total stars\n", such that the %d
//prints the value of numStars
return 0;
}
```

Tips:

outer loop `i` , count the `i` -th row;

inner loop `j`, count the `j` -th column, and print a `*` on each column;

function `printTriangle` print * triangle between two print strings in main;

actually, `starCount = numStars`, they count the total stars(on each row and column), can change/unify the name to one, either `starCount` or `numStars` ;

# Why error?

when exchange the position of the `main` box and `printTriangle` box, run the code and show below. 

```c
error: implicit declaration of function 'printTriangle' is invalid in C99 [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
starCount = printTriangle(4);
						^
1 error generated.
make: *** [<builtin>: math2] Error 1
```

The error is due to the compiler not being able to find a declaration for the function `printTriangle` before it’s used. In C, we need to declare functions before we use them. This can be done by providing a function prototype before the function call, or by defining the function entirely.
