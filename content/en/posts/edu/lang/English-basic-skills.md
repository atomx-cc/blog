# Long term practice - The basic skill of English

## **Pronunciation**

Why start from pronunciation?

pronunciation is the basic skill, is the first of all, most important core essence for language study. you pay 1 hour on this basic skill practice, it's more valuable than 3 hours you pay on grammar and vocabulary. so please forget to memory grammar, vocabulary, and complicated compound sentences in the first stage when you are studying langue.

As a foreigner from a non-English speaking country, we had better find a native English speaker tutor online, there are probably 2 style accents: UK, USA

## Vocabulary

how many words do you know? 

[Measure vocabulary size](https://my.vocabularysize.com/), but I think this website is not accurate for a test.

For an IELTS band score of 7, we should know at least 4000 words totally.

move more words from passive to active （被动 变 主动）vocabulary, our score will be improved.

intensive VS. extensive reading (集中精读到广泛阅读)
