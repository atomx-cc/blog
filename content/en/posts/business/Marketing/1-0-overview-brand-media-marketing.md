# Concepts Definition

**Brand, Advertising, Media, Communication, Public Relations, Publicity, Culture, Market, Sales, Marketing**

There are too many concepts related to **Marketing**, which are often confused by practitioners of the industry. In order to get more illegal profits, it is easier to defraud laymen and the innocent or ignorant public.

In order to clear the source, we searched for reliable information from modern Western business subjects to clarify its definition, connotation, and extension, As well as the structure and framework.

since then, ordinary people can start from 0 and quickly enter into regular marketing and sales. All related activities are collectively referred to as marketing as a concept here.

Marketing can be a great way to get a customer’s attention, but branding is a great way to keep their attention.

## Brand

A brand is a name, term, design, symbol, or any other feature that defines a business's image, establishing a "personality" for the company, product, or service in the minds of consumers.
That feature also identifies one seller's product or service as distinct from those of other sellers.

[Wiki: Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brand)

[Mckinsey Branding](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/how-we-help-clients/branding)

All activities related to **corporate identity** are collectively referred to as branding, primarily focusing on the design of abstract concepts that exist solely on paper.

Brand creation strategy encompasses the overall goals of advertising, marketing, and public relations, aiming to communicate with consumers, inform them about the value of goods, and encourage purchases, among other things.

Branding emphasizes the creation of an image related to goods, services, and the consumer base, then leveraging these factors in conjunction with marketing, advertising, and public relations. The role of branding is to shape the future prospects of the consumer base or the enterprise. It goes beyond just trademarks, slogans, and colors, and also utilizes the company's recognition. For example, customer service plays a vital role in brand promotion.

Branding involves predicting and positioning for the future landscape. Brand work requires accurate predictions about future industry trends and patterns, and making the most appropriate and advantageous market positioning for the brand. Brand work also requires defining the competitive framework, clarifying the current competitive framework of the category and the desired future competitive framework, and finding ways to upgrade the competitive framework.

**Branding requires mind positioning and setting brand associations.**

What position the brand will occupy in the minds of consumers, and what the key associations are, whether sensory associations, linguistic associations, or contextual associations.

<aside>
✍🏼 提示：在写营销框架的时候，我发现一个特别现象，几乎用不上问卷来提问，大量的自动化工具、AI出现，人工越来越少，从词性上分析，动词更多，而品牌和传媒更多名词，也就是表面在市场销售阶段的工作就是执行精准的动作。
