This is Atom's [Personal FAQ]


### Favorite movies?

Many, such as "Forrest Gump", "3 Idiots". But I usually don't watch movies.

Favorite genre is environmental documentaries, such as BBC's "Planet Earth" series, etc.

These highly-rated films have profoundly influenced me, changed my worldview, made me rethink technology, modern life, and the power of industry, so I switched careers to the agriculture industry.

[Food, Inc (2008)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food,_Inc)

[Home (2009)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_\(2009_film\))

Highly recommended to everyone, I have watched them many times.


### Favorite music?

Jazz, folk, classical, modern, any style sounds good.


### Favorite food?

I prefer vegetables and fruits to meat. I'm not addicted to coffee, tea, alcohol, tobacco or any food, am I boring?

I am not a strict picky eater, I follow the famous saying: eat local, fresh and seasonal food.

This slogan is popular in the movement to rethink industrialized food in the context of modern industrial pollution and destruction of the planet.

When someone asks me, what is your favorite food or music, etc.? I can never answer right away.
