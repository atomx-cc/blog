## China Meat Data Atlas

Time: 2019

Location: Beijing, Hangzhou

Data analysis and visualization for an environmental foundation.

**Project Overview:**

The project collected data from sources such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the European Union, and the United States Department of Agriculture. We engaged in original data mining, cleaning, analysis, and visualization, and wrote reports to study the production of animal husbandry and aquatic products and the consumption of meat in China compared to the world.

**Partner Institutions:**

- [China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Biodiversity_Conservation_and_Green_Development_Foundation), a large environmental foundation with a Chinese government background;
- [Good Food Fund](https://www.goodfoodchina.net/en), a project sponsor affiliated with CBCGDF;
- [Brighter Greenâ€™s consultants](https://brightergreen.org/), a US think tank providing expert support;

**Project Documents:**

It is expected that in the future, with continuous investment of resources, the version will be upgraded to a dynamic data dashboard, establishing a relational database to provide open source data verification and research services for institutions such as environment, education, scientific research, government, think tanks, and animal and plant-based protein producers;

Subtitling and training for environmental documentaries and open courses

**Project Overview:**

Compiled and published the earliest animal welfare open courses in mainland China on platforms such as [NetEase Open Courses](https://open.163.com/newview/movie/free?pid=AC9E1S3QJ), and translated a series of documents and materials used for training workshops by animal protection organizations.

Recruited and trained more than 20 volunteers for the China Animal Welfare Association, and completed the compilation and release of more than 120 short videos, covering topics such as: environment, biology, water, agriculture, food, health, cultural heritage, sustainable development, the future of mankind...

Note: Due to touching the platform supervision without clear rules, some videos could not pass the censorship, and the service quality of domestic video hosting platforms is generally poor, suspected of piracy and infringement issues, and finally gave up regrettably. Some surviving video links are as follows:
