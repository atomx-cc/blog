Here are the Worldviews, Outlooks on life, and Values that I enjoy sharing in ancient and modern Chinese contexts, typically used to describe two distinct attitudes towards life.

    Explanation: This expresses a strong determination to pursue progress and continuous improvement, stating that if one cannot improve and progress, then one would rather die. This attitude reflects a firm belief in self-improvement and the pursuit of excellence.

-   没有改进的人生不值得过！(Méi yǒu gǎi jìn de rén shēng bù zhí dé guò!) A life without improvement is not worth living!

     Explanation: If we do not pursue improvement and growth, life will lack meaning and passion. Such an attitude can inspire us to constantly challenge ourselves in all aspects and pursue excellence.

-   窮則獨善其身，富則達濟天下！(Qióng zé dú shàn qí shēn, fù zé dá jì tiān xià!) Cultivate oneself in poverty; help the world in wealth.

    Explanation: When we are in poverty, we should cultivate ourselves and strive for self-improvement; when we have the ability and resources, we should help others and benefit society.

-   先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐！(Xiān tiān xià zhī yōu ér yōu, hòu tiān xià zhī lè ér lè!) Worry before all under heaven; rejoice after all under heaven.

    Explanation: This reflects a high sense of social responsibility and a selfless spirit, emphasizing that we must always treat society's and others' problems as our own, and as long as there is injustice in society, we should tirelessly struggle until death.

-   修身、齐家、治国、平天下 (Xiū shēn, qí jiā, zhì guó, píng tiān xià) Cultivate oneself, regulate the family, govern the state, and bring peace to the world.

## Passive and Negative

    Explanation: If one cannot keep their own room clean and orderly, how can they expect to handle bigger tasks or more important, complex matters?

    Explanation: This saying describes a go-with-the-flow, passive, and lazy attitude toward life, just getting through the day, not being responsible for one's duties, not pursuing progress or change, focusing only on immediate benefits without considering long-term goals and responsibilities.
    
-   少壯不努力，老來徒傷悲 (Shào zhuàng bù nǔ lì, lǎo lái tú shāng bēi) If we don't work hard in our youth, we will regret it in our old age.

    Explanation: This ancient Chinese proverb emphasize the importance of seizing the time to work hard and study in our youth to avoid future regret and sorrow.

## This life can be without regrets!

Unfortunately,

We cannot change the external social environment,

But we can change our own small living environment.

If we cannot even manage what is inside our own walls,

Then we can at least manage ourselves.

We will not become the kind of person we once disliked!

When we are old, we will not hate ourselves,

We will end our life with a clear conscience.
