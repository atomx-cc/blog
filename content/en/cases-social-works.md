## China Meat Data Atlas

Data analysis and visualization of environmental protection foundations.

**Project Overview:**

The organizer is the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (hereinafter referred to as China Green Development Foundation), and its affiliated branch public welfare organization - Good Food Foundation, which is China's first large-scale environmental protection fund with a government background. The cooperating American think tank is [Brighter Green’s consultants](https://brightergreen.org/).

**Project File**
The project collects data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the European Union, and the US Department of Agriculture. We are engaged in raw data mining, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and report writing to study the production and meat consumption of livestock and aquatic products in China compared with the world.

It is expected that in the future, with the continuous investment of resources, the version will be upgraded to a dynamic data large screen Dash board, and a relational database will be established to provide open source data verification and research services for institutions such as environment, education, scientific research, government, think tanks, animal and plant-based protein producers;
